About Me

I am a Master’s student in Museology and Museography at the Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Lisbon, with a background in Sciences of Art and Heritage. My academic path has focused on the preservation and promotion of cultural heritage, particularly in the field of accessibility.

My interest in accessibility emerged from observing the barriers faced by elderly visitors and people less familiar with cultural environments. This experience led me to explore how museums and cultural institutions can become more inclusive, both physically and digitally.

I am currently learning programming to develop skills in digital accessibility and inclusive design. My goal is to combine heritage studies with technical knowledge in order to contribute to accessible, user-centered digital experiences within the cultural sector.
